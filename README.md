Masquerade:

Masquerade is a thrilling online cooperative game where players delve into a world of secrecy and suspense. In this virtual masquerade ball, participants are assigned hidden roles as either protectors or deceivers. The game unfolds in alternating phases of night and day. Under the cloak of night, characters such as the cunning Mafia, vigilant Doctor, shrewd Role Blocker, keen Inspector, and the unpredictable Redirector, execute their covert actions. As dawn breaks, the town congregates to piece together the night's mysteries and decide whom to trust. A vote determines who among them has betrayed the masquerade, leading to dramatic eliminations until the deception is unveiled or the deceivers reign supreme. Masquerade is an experience of intrigue and deduction, a battle of wits, where every move could be a masquerade.
